# 🎯 Hyperparameter Tuning & Threshold Optimization in Classification

This project focuses on optimizing a machine learning model’s performance through **hyperparameter tuning** and **classification threshold adjustment**. It demonstrates how fine-tuning and threshold selection can significantly affect model evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🔍 Features

- Train-test split and baseline model evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- ROC Curve and AUC analysis
- Threshold shifting to balance precision and recall
- Confusion matrix comparison before and after optimization

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cnu12224/Hyper_Parameters_Tuning_and_Threshold_Optimization.git
